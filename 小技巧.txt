,especially when over people.

without overrelying on expert knowledge for modeling and analysis

these devices is increasingly important as thry become more ubiquitous

Transformer has not been widely applied as the backbone in the field of fault diagnosis,
especially

the model-based diagnosis method has good robustness and can diagnose unknown faults, but the premise of this method is to establish an accurate model for the target system, but the structual parameters of the quadrotor UAV are relatively complicated.
Therefore, this method relies too much on the mathematical model of the
object, which is not easy to implement in practical applications and has limited scalability

a real-time simulation platform

Feature extraction remove useless data and preserve important
